# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The objective is to analyze passenger demographics, survival rates, and key influencing factors using various statistical and visualization techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Details

## This project involves:

# Data Cleaning: 
Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and preparing data for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Performing univariate and bivariate analysis to understand patterns in the dataset.

# Visualization: 
Using graphs and charts to uncover trends related to survival rates.

# Key Insights:
Identifying factors that contributed to passenger survival, such as gender, class, and fare prices.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Women and children had higher survival rates compared to men.

Passengers in first class had a better chance of survival than those in second or third class.

Fare price and embarkation point also influenced survival probabilities.

Missing age values were estimated using median age for similar passengers.

## ðŸš€ Future Work

# Feature Engineering:
Creating new features to improve data analysis and predictions.

# Machine Learning Model:
Applying classification algorithms to predict survival.

# Deployment:
Developing a web-based Titanic survival predictor.

# The project aims to extract meaningful insights and demonstrate data analysis techniques that can be applied to similar datasets in real-world scenarios.
